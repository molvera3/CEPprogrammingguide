# Adobe Photoshop CEP programming guide
If you are like me, you love programming and you are interested in writting panels / extensions for Adobe Photoshop. So I made a guide on how to get you started and avoid you some headaches by shadring with you the path I took to learn what I know today.

**WHO AM I?**

I'm a freelance multidiciplinary artist who founded a software company and a [Artist Community](http://facebook.com/groups/compositenation) called [Composite Nation](http://compositenation.com) on April 2018, which is my main life playground and hobby. I spent I had to learn to be a full-stack developer to build my project the way I visioned. I'm working on this 24/7 and nothing excites me more than learning how I can expand this even more.

Composite Nation and Oniric have been the most difficult thing that I have tried and at the same time the most satisfactory, the biggest challenge that have put my self in my life.

ThereÂ´s is a point that you reach when you study programming that you are able to understand the fundamentals and it becomes an irresistible satisfaction when seeing code, at least that happens to me.Being able to understand those paragraphs that I have ever seen as hieroglyphics fills my brain with dopamine, it makes my creativity spurt.

You can join the Community and Support group to see what the Composite Nation members are doing with the various softwares I've created so far.
