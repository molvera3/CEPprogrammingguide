# Adobe Photoshop CEP programming guide
If you are like me, you love programming and you are interested in writting panels / extensions for Adobe Photoshop. So I made a guide on how to get you started and avoid you some headaches by shadring with you the path I took to learn what I know today.

**WHO AM I?**

I'm a one man army who founded a software company and a creative artists community called [Composite Nation](http://compositenation.com), which is my main life playground and hobby. I had to learn to be a developer to build my project the way I visioned. I'm still working on it 24/7 and nothing excites me more than learning how I can expand this even more.
