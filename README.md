# Adobe Photoshop programming guide (How I got involved on developing software that can be used inside Photoshop?)
If you are like me, you love programming and you are interested plugins or extensions / panels works inside a software like for Adobe Photoshop. So I made a quick guide on how to get you started and avoid you some headaches by shadring with you the path I took to learn what I know today, but first I'll tell you a little bit about who I am.

I'm Mario OM, a freelance Photographer, Retoucher, Matte Painter, CGI artist, basically a multidiciplinary artist who founded a software company and a [Artist Community](http://facebook.com/groups/compositenation) called [Composite Nation](http://compositenation.com) on April 15 2018, which is my main life playground and hobby. I spent 2 years destroying walls and finding ways to learn to program what I wanted to program, It was very deifficult for me becuase I was not used to think logically but with a more chaothic and less structural thought patterns. I had to learn to be a full-stack developer to build my project the way I visioned. Today I work on this 24/7 and nothing excites me more than learning new ways to expand this even more. My life changed drastically when I start started learning to program, even my artistic vision was expanded 10xINFINITE.

So here's how I started:

# PHASE 1
I started by learning the most basic stuff, the foundation of programming on this amazing site, the language I learned first was [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/JavaScript). Which is the main language that is used on this Adobe Photoshop extensions and scripts.
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) Here you can learn step by step the foundation of Javascript.
* [Solo Learn](https://www.sololearn.com/) This is another amazing website to learn to program the basics. I have this one installed on my smartphone and when I travel I enjoy a lot learning another languages. Here I practice a lot my knowledge with Javascript and I learned the foundation of other languages like Pythong and C++. But let's just focus on Javascript today.

Javascript is such an amazing language, once you understand all the things that can be done with this. You can even create stand alone apps aswell with this language using frameworks like [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and the same I use for my server side, the powerful [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/es/).

# PHASE 2
Once I was a little bit more condifent by understanding how to read Javascript every where (at least the foundation), I found and bought [HTMLPanelsBook](https://www.htmlpanelsbook.com/), an amazing course by this funny and talented italian developer, [Davide Barranca](https://www.davidebarranca.com/). You'll see how it is very easy to follow his teaching on this course, it is so clear that even though after two years that I took the course I still learn something from it. So this is a extremely recommended course for you if you are interested to write CEP Panels / Extensions for Adobe Photoshop.

Composite Nation and Oniric have been the most difficult thing that I have tried and at the same time the most satisfactory, the biggest challenge that have put my self in my life.

ThereÂ´s is a point that you reach when you study programming that you are able to understand the fundamentals and it becomes an irresistible satisfaction when seeing code, at least that happens to me.Being able to understand those paragraphs that I have ever seen as hieroglyphics fills my brain with dopamine, it makes my creativity spurt.

You can join the Community and Support group to see what the Composite Nation members are doing with the various softwares I've created so far.
